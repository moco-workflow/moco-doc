# Activity Catalog

An **activity** is a unit of work a workflow performs outside itself: an HTTP call, a database
query, a shell command, an LLM completion. Activities are grouped into **providers**, and an
activity's type is `<provider>.<name>` — `http.request`, `builtin.state.set_state`,
`llama_index.query`.

This page indexes every activity the platform ships. Each provider has its own reference page with
the input and output contract of each of its activities, and worked examples.

For what an activity *is* and how to write one into a workflow, see
[Activity System](../concepts/activities.md) and the
[`activity` statement](./statements.md#activity).

## How to read this reference

Every activity is invoked the same way, so the statement-level fields — `type`, `input_data`,
`config_data`, `output_name`, `output_data`, `retry_policy`, `execute_locally`, `async_mode`,
`enable_cache` — are documented once in [Activity System](../concepts/activities.md) rather than
repeated on each page. The provider pages cover only what is specific to an activity:

- **Description** — what it does and when to reach for it.
- **Input** — the fields of `input_data`, with types, defaults and which are required.
- **Output** — the shape of the result, which `output_name` captures and `output_data` transforms.
- **Examples** — real YAML, drawn from `moco-examples/` wherever an example exists.

## Conventions across providers

### Secrets are named, not inlined

A field ending `_secret_key` holds the **name of a secret**, never the secret itself:
`apikey_secret_key`, `connection_string_secret_key`, `password_secret_key`,
`auth.credentials_secret_key`. The activity resolves and decrypts it internally, so plaintext never
enters workflow context. A bare `NAME` resolves a user-scoped secret; `global/NAME` resolves a
global one. See [Secret Activities](./activities/secret.md).

Four exceptions are worth knowing:

- [`http.request`](./activities/http.md#authentication) takes `encrypted_auth_token` — the still-encrypted
  blob from `builtin.secret.get` — rather than a secret name.
- [`graphql.subscribe`](./activities/graphql.md), [`websocket.subscribe`](./activities/websocket.md) and
  [`mcp.call_tool`](./activities/mcp.md) authenticate with a plain `headers` dict, which passes
  through workflow context in plaintext.
- [`langfuse.*`](./activities/langfuse.md) takes raw credentials inline; prefer configuring them as
  environment variables on the worker.
- [`k8s.*`](./activities/k8s.md#setup) names its token and client key through `token_secret_key` and
  `client_key_secret_key` as usual, but also accepts an inline `ca_cert` — a CA certificate is public
  material, so routing it through the secret store buys nothing.

### Retry and timeout defaults

The platform default is **60 seconds and 3 attempts**. Activities whose work is not idempotent —
writes, sends, spend — ship `max_attempts: 1` instead, and the exceptions are called out on each
page. Override either per call with `retry_policy`.

Only the Temporal runtime honours retry, timeout and heartbeat settings; the in-memory runtime
ignores them.

### Long-running activities and the relay pattern

Six activities run for as long as their source keeps producing, and deliver what they receive as
**workflow events** rather than as a return value:

| Activity | Delivers |
| --- | --- |
| [`kafka.consume`](./activities/kafka.md#kafkaconsume) | Each Kafka message |
| [`rabbit.receive`](./activities/rabbit.md#rabbitreceive) | Each RabbitMQ message |
| [`graphql.subscribe`](./activities/graphql.md#graphqlsubscribe) | Each subscription payload |
| [`websocket.subscribe`](./activities/websocket.md#websocketsubscribe) | Each inbound frame |
| [`mcp.call_tool`](./activities/mcp.md#mcpcall_tool) | Each progress notification |
| [`claude_agent.query`](./activities/claude-agent.md#claude_agentquery) | Agent progress |

They all share the same three fields — `relay_topic`, `relay_event_type` and `target_workflow_id` —
and the workflow consumes what they publish with `wait_for`.

Two things follow. First, **start them asynchronously**: set `async_mode: true` or put them in a
parallel branch, or they block the workflow for their whole timeout, which is usually a day. Only
`rabbit.receive` defaults to async mode. Second, on the Temporal runtime **each relayed payload is a
workflow signal and a history entry**, and the engine retains at most 1000 unmatched events per
topic — so these suit low-rate control streams, not high-throughput data feeds.

[`k8s.wait`](./activities/k8s.md#k8swait) also runs long and heartbeats, but is not part of this
pattern: it polls until its condition holds and then returns normally, rather than relaying events.
Its result is the point, so it blocks by design.

### Where activities run

Every activity runs on the `base` worker (task queue `default`) except
[`claude_agent.query`](./activities/claude-agent.md), which runs on the `agent` worker (task queue
`agent`). Routing is automatic; nothing in the workflowspec changes. An activity served by a
different worker type cannot run locally, so `execute_locally` has no effect on it.

Conversely, the browser activities ([Playwright](./activities/playwright.md),
[Selenium](./activities/selenium.md)) and the short built-ins `builtin.now` and `builtin.delay`
default to `execute_locally: true`. For the browser activities this is load-bearing — it pins a
browser session to one worker — and must not be overridden.
