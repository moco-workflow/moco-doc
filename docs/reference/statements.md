# Statements Reference

Statements are the building blocks of Moco workflows. Every `body` in a workflowspec is a statement. Statements fall into two categories: **primitives** (leaf nodes that do work) and **composites** (containers that orchestrate other statements).

For full workflowspec context, see the [Workflowspec Reference](./workflowspec-reference.md). For
the activities an `activity` statement can invoke, see the
[Activity Catalog](./activity-catalog.md).

## Common Parameters

All statements support these optional parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Unique identifier for the statement |
| `description` | string | Human-readable description |
| `condition` | expression or list | Skip this statement if the expression is falsy |
| `output_name` | string | Variable to store the statement result |
| `output_data` | list | Data transformations to apply after execution |

---

## Primitive Statements

### transform

Evaluates expressions and assigns variables. The primary way to compute or reshape data.

```yaml
- transform:
    input_data:
      - temp: "{{ price * 1.08 }}"
    output_data:
      - total: "{{ temp }}"
      - message: "Total is {{ total }}"
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `input_data` | Variable assignments evaluated before `output_data` |
| `output_data` | Main transformation assignments |

---

### abort

Terminates or breaks execution with different behaviors.

```yaml
- abort:
    condition: "{{ price < 0 }}"
    type: raise
    message: "Invalid price: {{ price }}"
```

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `abort` | Abort the entire workflow |
| `terminate` | Gracefully terminate the workflow |
| `break` | Break out of the current sequence or parallel block |
| `break_iteration` | Break out of the current iteration loop |
| `raise` | Raise an error and fail the workflow |

---

### activity

Executes a registered activity (HTTP call, database query, custom function, etc.).

```yaml
- activity:
    type: http.request
    input_data:
      method: POST
      url: https://api.example.com/orders
      body:
        order_id: "{{ order_id }}"
    output_name: api_response
    retry_policy:
      timeout_sec: 30
      max_attempts: 3
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `type` | Activity type identifier (required) |
| `version` | Activity version (default: `1.0.0`) |
| `config_data` | Static configuration, evaluated once at workflow start |
| `input_data` | Dynamic input, evaluated each time the activity runs |
| `output_name` | Variable to store the activity result |
| `retry_policy` | Nested timeout/retry config (Temporal only): `timeout_sec` (per-attempt execution timeout), `schedule_to_close_timeout_sec`, `heartbeat_timeout_sec`, `heartbeat_interval_sec` (heartbeat cadence; heartbeating is enabled only when both `heartbeat_timeout_sec` and `heartbeat_interval_sec` are set), `max_attempts` (total attempts = initial + retries), `initial_interval_sec`, `backoff_coefficient`, `maximum_interval_sec`, `non_retryable_error_types` |
| `execute_locally` | Force local execution, bypassing Temporal. Overrides the activity's own default; omit it to keep that default |
| `enable_cache` | Enable result caching |
| `cache_policy` | Cache configuration (TTL, key) |

Every available activity type, with its input and output contract, is in the
[Activity Catalog](./activity-catalog.md).

Some activities already default to local execution, so `execute_locally` is rarely needed. Setting
it to `false` on a `selenium.*` or `playwright.*` activity breaks browser sessions — see
[Activities that are already local by default](../concepts/activities.md#activities-that-are-already-local-by-default).

---

### workflow

Executes a child workflow by reference or inline definition.

```yaml
- workflow:
    wfspec:
      name: process-order
      version: 1.0.0
    child_mode: sync
    input_data:
      order_id: "{{ order_id }}"
    output_name: order_result
```

| Child Mode | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `inline` | Runs in the parent's context, shares variables (default) |
| `sync` | Runs independently; parent waits for the result |
| `async` | Runs independently; parent waits only for start, gets `workflow_id` |
| `detached` | Runs completely independently; parent doesn't wait |

To define a workflow inline instead of by name:

```yaml
- workflow:
    wfspec:
      content:
        wfspec_name: inline-helper
        wfspec_version: 1.0.0
        input_data:
          x:
        output_name: result
        body:
          transform:
            output_data:
              - result: "{{ x * 2 }}"
    child_mode: inline
    input_data:
      x: 21
    output_name: doubled
```

---

### call

Invokes a [function](./workflowspec-reference.md#functions) defined in the enclosing wfspec's
`functions` list. A `call` is a compact shorthand for a `workflow` statement running in
`inline` mode: the function executes in a fresh context and its return value is mapped back
via `output_name` / `output_data`.

```yaml
- call:
    function: add          # matches a `function` in the wfspec's `functions`
    input_data:
      a: 1
      b: 2
    output_name: result
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `function` | Name of the function to call (required) |
| `input_data` | Arguments passed to the function; supports expressions |
| `output_name` | Context variable to store the function's return value |
| `output_data` | Transform the return value (`_raw_output` holds the raw return) |
| `condition` | Pre-condition; the call is skipped when it evaluates to false |

Functions may call sibling functions defined in the same wfspec. Recursion (a function
calling itself, directly or indirectly) is **not** supported — it is rejected by the cyclic
call-stack guard.

---

### wait_for

Waits for an event matching filter criteria, or until a timeout.

```yaml
- wait_for:
    event:
      topic: order_events
      match_expression: >
        {{ event.data.get('order_id') == order_id and
           event.data.get('status') == 'completed' }}
    timeout_sec: 60
    output_name: completion_event
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `event.topic` | Event topic to subscribe to |
| `event.event_type` | Only events with this exact type match |
| `event.match_expression` | Python expression to filter incoming events (`event` variable is the event object) |
| `timeout_sec` | Maximum wait time in seconds (required) |
| `output_name` | Variable to store the received event |

To collect the result of an activity started with `async_mode: true`, pass the token that
activity returned as `event.event_type` — see
[Async activity results](../concepts/events.md#async-activity-results).

---

### emit_event

Emits an event to the event bus.

```yaml
- emit_event:
    input_data:
      topic: notification_events
      data:
        type: order_created
        order_id: "{{ order_id }}"
      target_workflow_id: "{{ parent_id }}"
      metadata:
        priority: high
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `topic` | Event topic (required) |
| `data` | Event payload (required) |
| `target_workflow_id` | Route the event to a specific workflow (optional) |
| `metadata` | Additional event metadata (optional) |

---

### continue_as_new_checkpoint

Checks whether the runtime suggests restarting the workflow (e.g., Temporal event history nearing its size limit). If suggested, serializes workflow state and restarts execution from the beginning with the preserved state.

This is a no-op in the in-memory runtime. In Temporal, it triggers a continue-as-new when the SDK signals that history is getting large.

```yaml
- continue_as_new_checkpoint:
    name: checkpoint-after-processing
    serialize_data_context: true
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | null | Optional identifier for logging |
| `serialize_data_context` | boolean | true | Whether to include data context variables in the serialized state |
| `condition` | expression | null | Skip this statement if the expression is falsy |
| `enforce` | boolean | false | Restart regardless of runtime suggestion. Testing only |

After the restart the workflow body runs from the beginning, so the spec must skip work it has
already done. If the body is a single `state_machine`, prefer a state
[`checkpoint_policy`](#checkpoint_policy) instead — the runtime resumes in the right state by
itself.

---

### checkpoint_policy

Declared on a **state**, not as a statement. The runtime checkpoints while the machine sits in
that state and resumes it there afterwards, so the spec does not have to describe recovery.

```yaml
states:
  - name: idle
    checkpoint_policy:
      timeout_sec: 300
      event_count: 100
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `timeout_sec` | number \| expression | null | Checkpoint after this long in the state |
| `event_count` | integer | null | Checkpoint after this many events handled in the state |
| `serialize_data_context` | boolean | true | Whether to include data context variables |
| `auto_resume` | boolean | true | Resume in this state, skipping `on_enter`. False restarts the machine at `initial_state` |
| `enforce` | boolean | false | Checkpoint regardless of runtime suggestion. Testing only |

At least one of `timeout_sec` / `event_count` is required; if both are set, whichever trips
first wins.

An event counts toward `event_count` when a transition matched it for the current state and the
state is unchanged afterwards — internal transitions, self-transitions, and events whose
transition condition was false. Unmatched events do not count, and moving to a different state
resets the count.

Requires the wfspec body to be a single `state_machine` statement; a policy anywhere else is
rejected at parse time. On resume the state's `on_enter` is skipped (it already ran before the
checkpoint) and its timers are re-armed from their full duration.

#### Opting out of auto-resume

`auto_resume: false` keeps the checkpoint but skips the jump: the machine restarts at
`initial_state` with `on_enter` running normally.

Use it when an earlier state has a side effect the new execution needs again — typically an
`init` state that starts a long-running `async_mode` activity feeding the machine's
`event_source_topic`. Those activity handles do not survive continue-as-new, so resuming
straight into the state that consumed their events leaves the machine with no producer.

The record is still written, so the state the checkpoint fired in stays readable as
`__sys_info__.get("state_machine",{}).get("checkpointed_from_state")`. An `init` state can use it to re-run its
side effect and then route straight back, skipping one-time setup:

```yaml
states:
  - name: init
    on_enter:
      activity:                     # the subscriber, restarted every execution
        name: subscriber
        type: rabbit.receive
        async_mode: true
        async_event_topic: monitor_events
        output_name: subscriber_token
        input_data: { queue: prices }

  - name: monitoring
    checkpoint_policy:
      event_count: 100
      auto_resume: false

transitions:
  # Listed first: the first satisfied automatic transition wins.
  - from_state: init
    to_state: monitoring
    trigger:
      condition: '{{ __sys_info__.get("state_machine", {}).get("checkpointed_from_state") == "monitoring" }}'

  - from_state: init
    to_state: warmup
    trigger: null
```

`resumed_from_state` is set only when the machine actually jumped, so under `auto_resume: false`
it is null while `checkpointed_from_state` names the state. Both are null on a first run.

Two more keys sit alongside them, available in any state `on_enter`/`on_exit` and any transition
`action`/`condition` while the machine runs:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | The machine's `name`, or `unnamed_state_machine` if the spec omits it |
| `current_state` | The state the machine is in right now |

`current_state` is updated before a state's `on_enter` runs, so a state always sees itself rather
than the one it just left. During a transition's `action` it is still the source state. The whole
`state_machine` key is removed once the machine completes, and a nested machine shadows it and
restores the outer values on exit.

## Composite Statements

### sequence

Executes statements one after another.

```yaml
sequence:
  elements:
    - transform:
        output_data:
          - status: "validating"
    - activity:
        type: http.request
        input_data:
          url: https://api.example.com/validate
        output_name: validation
    - abort:
        condition: "{{ not validation.valid }}"
        type: raise
        message: "Validation failed"
```

---

### parallel

Executes statements concurrently with configurable join semantics.

```yaml
- parallel:
    join_type: and
    elements:
      - activity:
          name: fetch-user
          type: http.request
          input_data:
            url: https://api.example.com/users/{{ user_id }}
          output_name: user_data
      - activity:
          name: fetch-orders
          type: http.request
          input_data:
            url: https://api.example.com/orders?user={{ user_id }}
          output_name: order_data
```

| Join Type | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `and` | All branches must succeed |
| `or` | At least one branch must succeed |

---

### iteration

Loops over a collection, either sequentially or in parallel.

```yaml
- iteration:
    iter_type: sequence
    input_data: "{{ items }}"
    body:
      activity:
        type: process-item
        input_data:
          item: "{{ iter_item }}"
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `iter_type` | `sequence` (sequential) or `parallel` (concurrent) |
| `input_data` | Collection to iterate over (list, `dict.items()`, `range()`, etc.) |
| `body` | Statement executed for each item |
| `join_type` | For parallel iteration: `and` or `or` |

Special variables available inside the body:
- `iter_item` — the current item
- `iter_items` — all items in the collection

Use `abort` with `type: break_iteration` to exit the loop early.

---

### state_machine

Event-driven finite state machine. See [State Machines Reference](../concepts/state-machines.md) for full documentation.

```yaml
- state_machine:
    name: order-fsm
    initial_state: pending
    timeout_sec: 300
    states:
      - name: pending
      - name: processing
      - name: completed
        is_terminal: true
    transitions:
      - from_state: pending
        to_state: processing
        trigger:
          event_type: start
```

`trigger.event_type` accepts an expression, resolved against the workflow context on every
incoming event — see [expression triggers](../concepts/state-machines.md#expression-triggers).

---

### rules_engine

Declarative rule evaluation over a working memory of facts. See
[Rules Engine](../concepts/rules-engine.md) for full documentation.

```yaml
- rules_engine:
    name: loan-classification
    input_data:
      facts:
        credit_score: "{{ credit_score }}"
      run_mode: forward         # or: backward
      terminate_facts: [decision]
    rules:
      - id: credit_tier_excellent
        if:
          with_facts: [credit_score]
          expression: "{{ credit_score >= 750 }}"
        then:
          set_facts:
            - credit_tier: excellent
          actions:
            - emit_event:
                input_data:
                  topic: loan_events
                  event_type: tier_assigned
    output_name: derived_facts
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `rules` | List of rules, each with `id`, `if` (`with_facts` + `expression`), and `then` (`set_facts` and/or `actions`) |
| `input_data.facts` | Initial facts. In `backward` mode, a goal fact is given the value `null` |
| `input_data.run_mode` | `forward` (default, data-driven) or `backward` (goal-driven) |
| `input_data.fact_resolvers` | Map of fact name to a statement that produces it on demand |
| `input_data.terminate_facts` | Stop once all of these facts have been derived |
| `input_data.keep_alive` | Run as a continuous session fed by events. See [live mode](../concepts/rules-engine.md#live-mode-continuous-evaluation) |
| `input_data.fact_source_topic` | Topic carrying `set_facts` events in live mode (default: `default`) |
| `input_data.timeout_sec` | Wall-clock limit for a live session; supports expressions |
| `input_data.max_iterations` | Safety limit on evaluation cycles in live mode (default: 1000) |
| `output_name` / `output_data` | Receives the **derived** facts — those asserted by rules, not the seeded ones |
| `condition` | Pre-condition; the whole block is skipped when false |
