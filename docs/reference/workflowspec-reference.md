# Workflowspec Reference

A **workflowspec** (wfspec) is a YAML document that describes one workflow: its inputs, its
result, and the tasks it runs. This page is the complete reference for the wfspec language. The
individual task kinds are documented one by one in [Tasks](./statements.md), and the activities a
task can call are in the [Activity Catalog](./activity-catalog.md).

## A first wfspec

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: hello-world

input:
  name: world                         # declared input with a default

output:
  greeting: '{{ greeting }}'          # the workflow's result

main:
  tasks:
    - task_name: wait-a-moment
      activity:
        type: builtin.delay
        input:
          duration: 1s

    - task_name: build-greeting
      set:
        - greeting: 'Hello, {{ name }}! It is {{ now() }}'
```

Every wfspec has a `header` and a `main`. `main` is one **task**; here it is a `tasks` container
that runs two child tasks in order. Values inside `{{ }}` are Python expressions.

### File conventions

- One document per file. The usual suffix is `.yaml` (or `.wfspec.yaml`).
- Files are loaded with a safe YAML loader, which reads the bare words `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`,
  `y` and `n` as booleans. Quote them when you need them as keys or strings in `input`,
  `context` or activity data: `'yes': 1`.
- Document intent with YAML comments. Tasks have no `description` field.

## Document structure

### Top-level keys

| Key | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `header` | yes | mapping | Identity and metadata of the workflow |
| `context` | no | mapping | Initial workflow variables. Values may be expressions |
| `input` | no | mapping | Declared inputs and their defaults. Values are **not** evaluated |
| `output` | no | any | The workflow's result, evaluated after `main` completes |
| `functions` | no | mapping | Private sub-workflows of this document |
| `main` | yes | task | The task the workflow runs |

No other top-level keys are allowed.

### `header`

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: order-intake
  tags: [orders, intake]
  metadata:
    owner: team-orders                # free-form
    default_activity_retry_policy:    # read by the engine
      max_attempts: 3
      timeout_sec: 60
```

| Key | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | yes | Version of the wfspec language, `2.x.y`. Use `2.0.0` |
| `workflow_name` | yes | Name of the workflow. Lowercase letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, starting with a letter or digit |
| `tags` | no | List of strings, used for search and grouping |
| `metadata` | no | Free-form mapping. The engine reads one key: `default_activity_retry_policy`, the [retry policy](#retry-policy) every activity in the document starts from |

The header has no version. A workflow's version is the version of the package it is published in
(`moco.json`), so publishing a new release never requires editing the spec. See
[Release and Sharing](../concepts/release-and-sharing.md).

### `context`

Initial variables that always exist. Entries are evaluated in order, so a later entry can use an
earlier one. A name modifier on a key applies to its value (here `#literal` keeps a template
unevaluated).

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: context-example

context:
  started_at: '{{ now() }}'
  currency: USD
  greeting_template#literal: 'Dear {{ customer }},'
  audit_trail: []

main:
  set:
    - _log#: 'started at {{ started_at }} in {{ currency }}'
```

### `input`

The parameters a caller may pass, with their defaults. Values are taken as written, not
evaluated. A key with no value has the default `null`; nothing enforces that a caller provides it,
so validate required inputs with a [`raise`](./statements.md#raise) task.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: input-example

input:
  order_id:                           # null unless the caller passes it
  quantity: 1
  express: false

main:
  tasks:
    - task_name: require-order-id
      raise:
        if: '{{ not order_id }}'
        type: error
        error_type: ValidationError
        message: order_id is required
    - set:
        - shipping: '{{ "express" if express else "standard" }}'
```

### How the context is built

When a run starts, the workflow context is built in this order:

1. `context`, evaluated entry by entry.
2. `input`: the declared defaults, then the caller's values on top. Caller keys that are not
   declared are merged too. Caller keys that are [reserved names](#reserved-names) are dropped.
3. After a [checkpoint](./statements.md#checkpoint) restart, the saved context replaces the
   result of steps 1 and 2.

A caller can therefore override a `context` entry by passing the same key as input.

### `output`

The workflow's result, evaluated against the workflow context once `main` completes. It is either
a single expression or any structure containing expressions.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: output-example

output:
  order_id: '{{ order_id }}'
  total: '{{ total }}'
  lines: '{{ len(items) }}'

input:
  order_id: ORD-1
  items: [{price: 2.5}, {price: 4.0}]

main:
  set:
    - total: '{{ sum(i["price"] for i in items) }}'
```

- Without `output`, the workflow returns `{}`.
- `output: '{{ total }}'` returns a single value of any type.
- After [`raise: terminate`](#control-signals) the workflow still completes successfully and
  `output` is evaluated as usual. The engine adds a `terminate_message` key to a mapping result;
  any other result is wrapped as `{result: <value>, terminate_message: ...}`.

### `functions`

Functions are sub-workflows private to the document. Each has an optional `input` (parameters and
defaults), an optional `output` (its result) and a `main` task. Call one with a
[`workflow`](./statements.md#workflow) task and `function:`.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: functions-example

input:
  a: 3
  b: 4

output:
  hypotenuse: '{{ c }}'

functions:
  square:
    input:
      x: 0
    output: '{{ y }}'
    main:
      set:
        - y: '{{ x * x }}'

  hypotenuse:
    input:
      a: 0
      b: 0
    output: '{{ round((a2 + b2) ** 0.5, 3) }}'
    main:
      tasks:
        - workflow:
            function: square          # a function may call its siblings
            input: {x: '{{ a }}'}
          output:
            as: a2
        - workflow:
            function: square
            input: {x: '{{ b }}'}
          output:
            as: b2

main:
  task_name: compute
  workflow:
    function: hypotenuse
    input:
      a: '{{ a }}'
      b: '{{ b }}'
  output:
    as: c                             # 5.0
```

- Function names use letters, digits, `_` and `-`, starting with a letter or `_`.
- A call runs with a fresh context built only from its `input`. The function cannot see or change
  the caller's variables.
- A function can call sibling functions, but not itself, directly or indirectly. Recursion fails
  at runtime.
- Functions are callable only from the document that defines them.

### `main`

Exactly one task. Most workflows use a `tasks` container here; a workflow that does one thing can
use that task directly.

---

## Tasks

Everything under `main` is a **task**. A task is a mapping with:

- **exactly one kind key**, which says what the task does;
- any of the [shared keys](#shared-task-keys) `task_name`, `skip_if`, `props`, `output`,
  `on_error`;
- nothing else. In particular, a task has no `input` key (kinds that take input declare it
  themselves, such as `activity.input`) and no `description`.

```yaml
# Look the user up                       <- intent goes in a comment
task_name: fetch-user                    # shared key
skip_if: '{{ not user_id }}'             # shared key
activity:                                # the kind
  type: http.request
  input:
    method: GET
    url: 'https://api.example.com/users/{{ user_id }}'
    output_json: true
output:                                  # shared key
  data: '{{ _["json"] }}'
  as: user
```

| Category | Kind | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Primitive | [`activity`](./statements.md#activity) | Calls an activity (HTTP, SQL, shell, LLM, ...) |
| Primitive | [`workflow`](./statements.md#workflow) | Runs a child workflow or a function |
| Primitive | [`set`](./statements.md#set) | Assigns variables |
| Primitive | [`raise`](./statements.md#raise) | Fails, or stops early with a control signal |
| Primitive | [`emit_event`](./statements.md#emit_event) | Publishes an event |
| Primitive | [`wait_for`](./statements.md#wait_for) | Waits for an event, or sleeps |
| Primitive | [`checkpoint`](./statements.md#checkpoint) | Restarts the run with its state saved (continue-as-new) |
| Primitive | [`state_machine`](./statements.md#state_machine) | Runs an event-driven state machine |
| Primitive | [`rules_engine`](./statements.md#rules_engine) | Evaluates rules over a set of facts |
| Container | [`tasks`](./statements.md#tasks) | Runs child tasks, in sequence or in parallel |
| Control flow | [`loop`](./statements.md#loop) | Runs a task once per item |
| Control flow | [`switch`](./statements.md#switch) | Picks a task by comparing one value |
| Control flow | [`branches`](./statements.md#branches) | Picks a task by `if` / `elif` / `else` conditions |

Each kind produces a **raw output**, bound to `_` while the task's `output` is processed. The
[Tasks](./statements.md) page lists what `_` is for each kind.

---

## Values and expressions

### How a value is evaluated

Almost every value in a wfspec is evaluated before it is used: `context` entries, activity
`input`, `set` values, `output`, conditions, and so on. Evaluation is recursive:

| Value | Result |
|---|---|
| Mapping | A mapping with each value evaluated. Keys are not evaluated |
| List | Each element evaluated |
| String without `{{` | The string itself |
| String that is exactly one `{{ e }}` (surrounding spaces allowed) | The value of Python expression `e`, **keeping its type** (number, list, dict, `None`, ...) |
| Any other string containing `{{` | Interpolation: each `{{ e }}` is replaced by `str()` of its value, and the result is a string |
| Number, boolean, `null` | Itself |

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: evaluation-example

input:
  name: Ada
  prices: [15.99, 8.5, 25.0]

output: '{{ report }}'

main:
  set:
    - report:
        count: '{{ len(prices) }}'                  # 3 (an int)
        cheapest: '{{ min(prices) }}'               # 8.5 (a float)
        summary: '{{ name }} has {{ len(prices) }} items'   # a string
        ranked: '{{ sorted(prices, reverse=True) }}'        # a list
        status: pending                              # no {{ }}: a plain string
```

`input` defaults are the one place where values are not evaluated.

### Expression syntax

An expression is a single Python expression, not a statement: no assignments, `import`, `def` or
`for` loops. Comprehensions, conditional expressions, f-strings and lambdas all work.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: expression-syntax-example

input:
  people:
    - {name: Ada, dept: eng, salary: 120}
    - {name: Bo, dept: ops, salary: 90}

main:
  set:
    - eng_names: '{{ [p["name"] for p in people if p["dept"] == "eng"] }}'
    - label: '{{ "big" if len(people) > 10 else "small" }}'
    - headline: '{{ f"{len(people)} people, first is {people[0]}" }}'
    # A long expression may span lines; newlines inside {{ }} are treated as spaces.
    - stats: |
        {{
          {
            "headcount": len(people),
            "avg_salary": round(sum(p["salary"] for p in people) / len(people), 1)
          }
        }}
```

Quoting tips:

- Wrap expressions in single quotes so that double quotes can be used inside them.
- A `#` inside a `>` or `>-` folded scalar is part of the expression text, so Python reads it as
  a comment that runs to the end of the folded line, which is the whole expression. Do not put
  comments inside multi-line expressions.

### What expressions can use

| Kind | Available |
|---|---|
| Builtins | Python builtins, except unsafe ones such as `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `open`, `input`, `globals`, `vars`, `dir`, `type`, `getattr`, `setattr`, `delattr`, `hasattr` |
| Libraries | `np` (numpy), `pd` (pandas), `pa` (pyarrow), `glom`, `json`, `yaml`, `re`, `base64`, `bs4` (BeautifulSoup), `dt` (`datetime` module), `rd` (`dateutil.relativedelta`) |
| Helpers | `now()` (current time, deterministic on replay), `uuid4()`, `copy`, `deepcopy`, `remap`, `StringIO`, `encrypt` |
| Variables | Every visible variable, by bare name. See [Scopes and name resolution](#scopes-and-name-resolution) |

Library access is restricted to safe functions: submodules, file access and code-loading functions
are blocked.

### Special names

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `_` | The current task's raw output, inside its `output` (and the error, inside `on_error.do`) |
| `__context__` | A read-only mapping of every visible variable, merged innermost-first. `"x" in __context__` asks whether `x` is defined here |
| `__sys_info__` | Information about the run: `workflow_id`, `trace_id` (shared by a workflow and all its children), `tier`, `debug_mode`, `is_continue_as_new`, and `state_machine` inside a state machine |
| `__user_info__` | The user who started the run: `user_id`, `user_org`, `requester_user_id`, `auth_mode` |
| `event` | The current event, inside `wait_for.event.match_expression` and state machine callbacks and conditions |

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: special-names-example

input:
  region:

main:
  set:
    - workflow_id: '{{ __sys_info__.get("workflow_id") }}'
    - user_id: '{{ __user_info__.get("user_id") }}'
    - region_given: '{{ "region" in __context__ and region is not None }}'
```

### Evaluation modifiers

By default a value is evaluated as a Python expression. A modifier on the variable name changes
how its value is evaluated. Modifiers are written after the name and are stripped before the
value is stored (`report#jinja` stores `report`).

| Modifier | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| `#python` | Python expression in `{{ }}` (the default) |
| `#literal` | None. The value is kept exactly as written, braces included |
| `#jinja` | Rendered as a sandboxed Jinja2 template, with every visible variable available. Use it for `{% if %}` / `{% for %}` and filters |
| `#python_glom` | The value is a glom spec, applied to `__context__`: `glom(__context__, <value>)`. A path must be a quoted Python string |

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: modifiers-example

input:
  people:
    - {name: Ada, dept: eng}
    - {name: Bo, dept: ops}

main:
  set:
    # Kept as text, for example to render later or pass to another system.
    - template#literal: 'Hello {{ name }}'

    # Jinja2 has statements and filters, which one Python expression does not.
    - roster#jinja: |
        {% for p in people | sort(attribute='name') %}
        - {{ p.name | upper }} ({{ p.dept }})
        {% endfor %}

    # A glom path. Note the inner quotes: the value is Python, not a bare path.
    - first_dept#python_glom: '"people.0.dept"'
```

Modifiers chain left to right, each applied to the previous result; later passes act only on
strings. `#python#python` evaluates twice, which turns a string into a second expression:

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: chained-modifiers-example

context:
  user_email: ada@example.com

main:
  set:
    - pointer#literal: '{{ user_email }}'    # stored as the text '{{ user_email }}'
    # pass 1: '{{ pointer }}'    -> '{{ user_email }}'
    # pass 2: '{{ user_email }}' -> 'ada@example.com'
    - value#python#python: '{{ pointer }}'
```

Modifiers can be used wherever a variable is written: `context` keys, `set` and `output.set`
keys, `output.as`, and the keys of the `input` maps of `activity`, `workflow` and `rules_engine`.

---

## Conditions

`skip_if`, `raise.if`, `branches` items, `wait_for.event.match_expression`, state machine
`trigger.condition` and rule `if.expression` all take a **condition**:

```text
condition := '{{ <expression> }}'
           | and: [condition, ...]      # every sub-condition holds
           | or:  [condition, ...]      # any sub-condition holds
           | not: condition
```

- An expression condition must evaluate to a `bool`. Anything else, including `None`, `0` or an
  empty list, fails with `ConditionTypeError`. Write `{{ len(items) > 0 }}`, not `{{ items }}`.
- `and` and `or` take a non-empty list and short-circuit.
- The tree nests freely.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: conditions-example

input:
  age: 30
  country: US
  is_member: true
  is_banned: false

main:
  tasks:
    - task_name: domestic-adult-member
      skip_if:
        not:
          and:
            - '{{ age >= 18 }}'
            - '{{ country == "US" }}'
            - '{{ is_member }}'
      set:
        - tier: domestic-premium

    - task_name: eligible
      skip_if:
        or:
          - '{{ is_banned }}'
          - '{{ age < 13 }}'
      set:
        - eligible: true
```

---

## Variable names (write targets)

A **write target** is a place where a variable is written: the keys of `context`, `set` and
`output.set`, the value of `output.as`, and the keys of the `input` maps of `activity`,
`workflow` and `rules_engine`. A target is a name with optional markers:

```text
target   :=  [_]name[@][#modifier...][#]
          |  '{{ name[<key>]... }}'          # subscript assignment, set and output.set only

name     :=  a letter, then letters, digits or _
modifier :=  python | literal | jinja | python_glom
```

| Part | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Write to the workflow context |
| `_name` | Write to the **task-local** scope: visible to the rest of this task, then discarded |
| `name@` | Write to the **container scope**: the nearest enclosing `tasks` container or loop iteration |
| `#modifier` | Evaluate the value with this [modifier](#evaluation-modifiers). Repeatable |
| trailing `#` | Log the stored value as a debug event, shown by the `moco` CLI |

Markers combine in that order: `greeting_html@#jinja#` is a container-scoped variable rendered
with Jinja2 and logged.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: write-targets-example

input:
  prices: [10, 20, 30]
  tax_rate: 0.08

output:
  total: '{{ total }}'

main:
  tasks:
    - task_name: subtotal
      set:
        - _sum: '{{ sum(prices) }}'                # task-local: only this task
        - subtotal@: '{{ _sum }}'                  # container: later siblings
    - task_name: total
      set:
        - _tax: '{{ round(subtotal * tax_rate, 2) }}'
        - total#: '{{ subtotal + _tax }}'          # context, and logged
```

Rules:

- A name cannot both start with `_` and end with `@`.
- A name cannot be `_` or a [reserved name](#reserved-names).
- An unknown modifier (`#yaml`) is rejected when the wfspec is validated.
- The scope markers `_` and `@` mean something only in `set`, `output.set` and `output.as`. In
  `context` keys and `input` maps, only the modifiers and the trailing `#` apply.

### Debug logging with a trailing `#`

A trailing `#` emits a `data_log` debug event with the value that was stored. The `moco` CLI
prints these events while the workflow runs, which makes it the main tool for inspecting a
workflow. `_log#: '...'` is a common idiom: a throwaway task-local whose only purpose is the log
line.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: debug-log-example

input:
  items: [a, b]

main:
  set:
    - _log#: 'processing {{ len(items) }} items'
    - first#: '{{ items[0] }}'
```

### Subscript assignment

In `set` and `output.set`, a key written as an expression with literal subscripts assigns into an
existing dict or list, instead of creating a variable. The root name must already be visible.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: subscript-assignment-example

context:
  profile:
    name: ''
    address: {city: ''}

main:
  set:
    - "{{ profile['name'] }}": Ada
    - "{{ profile['address']['city'] }}": London
```

---

## Shared task keys

These keys can appear on a task of any kind.

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `task_name` | string | Identifies the task in logs, traces, debug events and tests. Unique within the document |
| `skip_if` | [condition](#conditions) | When true, the task does not run |
| `props` | mapping | Options; `execute_mode` and `join_type` configure a `tasks` container |
| `output` | `{set, data, as}` | Processes the task's raw output into its result |
| `on_error` | `{catch, do}` | Handles an error raised by the task |

### `task_name`

Optional, but name every task you want to find in a trace, mock in a test, or target with a unit
test (a test's `step_name` refers to a `task_name`). Names must be unique across the whole
document, including nested tasks and tasks inside `functions`.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: task-name-example

main:
  task_name: build-greeting
  set:
    - greeting: hello
```

### `skip_if`

When the condition is true, the task is skipped: it does not run, its result is `null`, and its
`output` is not processed, so nothing is written. A later task that reads a variable the skipped
task would have written must check for it, or the variable must be given a default in
`context`.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: skip-if-example

context:
  greeting: Hello, stranger!          # default for the skipped path

input:
  first_name: jon
  last_name: doe

output: '{{ greeting }}'

main:
  skip_if:
    or:
      - '{{ not first_name }}'
      - '{{ not last_name }}'
  set:
    - greeting: 'Hello, {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}!'
```

### `props`

An open mapping. The engine reads two keys, and only on a `tasks` container:

| Key | Values | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `execute_mode` | `sequential`, `parallel` | `sequential` | How the container runs its children |
| `join_type` | `all`, `any` | `all` | In parallel mode: wait for every child, or take the first to succeed |

Other keys are kept for tools and UIs. A loop sets its iteration mode with `loop.execute_mode`,
not with `props`. See [`tasks`](./statements.md#tasks).

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: props-example

main:
  task_name: two-at-once
  props:
    execute_mode: parallel
    join_type: all
    ui_group: demo                    # ignored by the engine
  tasks:
    - activity:
        type: builtin.delay
        input: {duration: 1s}
    - activity:
        type: builtin.delay
        input: {duration: 2s}
```

### `output`

Turns the task's raw output, `_`, into its **result**, and stores what you need. It has three
optional parts, processed in this order:

| Part | Description |
|---|---|
| `set` | An ordered list of assignments, exactly like a [`set`](./statements.md#set) task. `_` is the raw output |
| `data` | The task's result. Defaults to `_`. Can use task-locals written by `output.set` |
| `as` | A [write target](#variable-names-write-targets) that stores the result |

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: task-output-example

output:
  order: '{{ order }}'
  last_order_id: '{{ last_order_id }}'

main:
  task_name: create-order
  activity:
    type: http.request
    input:
      method: POST
      url: https://httpbin.org/post
      json_data: {order_id: ORD-1, items: [{sku: A, qty: 2}]}
      output_json: true
  output:
    set:
      - _body: '{{ _["json"]["json"] }}'        # task-local
      - last_order_id: '{{ _body["order_id"] }}'  # context write
    data:
      id: '{{ _body["order_id"] }}'
      lines: '{{ len(_body["items"]) }}'
    as: order
```

- `output` never writes to the context by itself. A key of `_` becomes a variable only when
  `output.set` or `output.as` writes it. A child workflow that returns `{currency: EUR}` does not
  change your `currency` variable.
- `as` honours the scope markers: `as: page@` stores in the enclosing container's scope. On a
  `tasks` container itself, `@` in its own `output` refers to that container's scope, which ends
  with it, so store a container's result in the context instead.
- The result (from `data`, or `_`) is what the parent sees: an item of a `tasks` container's
  result list, or one iteration's result in a `loop`.
- On a container, `output` runs once, after all of its children.

### `on_error`

Handles an error raised by the task's kind or by its `output`. See
[Errors and control signals](#errors-and-control-signals).

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `catch` | `false` | `true`: the error is consumed and the task succeeds. `false`: the error propagates after `do` runs |
| `do` | none | A task to run when the error happens. Inside it, `_` is the error |

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: on-error-example

context:
  error: null

input:
  first_name:

output:
  error: '{{ error }}'

main:
  task_name: validate
  raise:
    if: '{{ not first_name }}'
    type: error
    error_type: ValidationError
    message: first_name is missing
  on_error:
    catch: true
    do:
      set:
        - error#: '{{ _["error_type"] }}: {{ _["error_message"] }}'
```

---

## How a task runs

For every task, the engine runs these steps in order:

1. **Guard.** Evaluate `skip_if`. If it is true, the task's result is `null` and the task ends.
   A `raise` task also evaluates its `if` here; if it is false, the result is `null`.
2. **Run.** Execute the kind and bind `_` to its raw output.
3. **Errors.** If step 2 or steps 4 to 6 fail, hand the error to `on_error`.
4. **`output.set`.** Process the assignments in order.
5. **`output.data`.** Evaluate it, or use `_`. This is the task's **result**.
6. **`output.as`.** Store the result.
7. **Clean up.** Discard the task's local scope and return the result to the parent.

Consequences:

- A skipped task writes nothing, and its `output` does not run.
- Task-locals (`_name`) written by a `set` task are still visible in that task's `output`.
- A control signal (`raise: exit`, `break`, `continue`, `terminate`) skips steps 4 to 6 of every
  task it passes through.

---

## Scopes and name resolution

### The three scopes

| Written as | Scope | Visible to | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | **Workflow context** | Every later task and the workflow's `output` | The whole run; saved on checkpoint |
| `name@` | **Container scope**: the nearest enclosing `tasks` container or loop iteration | Later siblings and their descendants | Until that container or iteration ends |
| `_name` | **Task-local** | The rest of the same task: later `set` entries, `output.set`, `output.data`, `output.as` | Until the task ends |

A `name@` written outside any container lands in the workflow's root scope: readable by every task,
but not part of the workflow context or the checkpointed state.

### Reading a name

A bare name is looked up innermost first:

1. the [special names](#special-names) (`_`, `__context__`, `event`, ...);
2. the current task's local scope;
3. the container scopes, from the innermost outwards;
4. the workflow context.

The first match wins, so a container-scoped `discount@` hides a `discount` in the context for as
long as its container runs. An unknown name fails with `NameError`. `__context__` holds the same
merge as a mapping; test membership with `"x" in __context__`.

Writing `name` always writes the context, even when a scoped `name@` hides it: readers inside the
scope keep seeing the scoped value.

### Container scopes in loops and parallel tasks

Every loop iteration opens a fresh container scope holding the loop variable (`foreach`, and
`index` if named). Values written with `@` inside an iteration stay private to it, so iterations
never overwrite each other's temporaries, even in parallel.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: scopes-example

input:
  orders:
    - {id: order-1, amount: 150.0}
    - {id: order-2, amount: 49.99}

output:
  processed: '{{ processed }}'
  leaked: '{{ leaked }}'

main:
  tasks:
    - task_name: price-orders
      loop:
        in: '{{ orders }}'
        foreach: order
        execute_mode: parallel
        do:
          tasks:
            - set:
                - discount@: '{{ 0.10 if order["amount"] >= 100 else 0.0 }}'
            - set:
                - final@: '{{ round(order["amount"] * (1 - discount), 2) }}'
          output:
            data: {id: '{{ order["id"] }}', final: '{{ final }}'}
      output:
        as: processed

    # order, discount and final are gone; only processed is left.
    - set:
        - leaked: '{{ [n for n in ("order", "discount", "final") if n in __context__] }}'
```

In a parallel `tasks` container or parallel loop, each child or iteration works on its own copy of
the enclosing container scopes, so siblings cannot see each other's `@` writes. Writes to the
workflow context are applied as the children finish.

### Boundaries

| Boundary | What is visible inside |
|---|---|
| `workflow` child and `function` call | Only the child's own `input`, as a fresh context. Nothing from the caller |
| State machine `on_enter`, `on_exit`, `action`, `condition` | The workflow context and `event`. Container scopes around the state machine are not visible |
| Rules engine rule expressions | The facts, as bare names |
| Rules engine `actions` | The workflow context, like a state machine callback |

---

## Errors and control signals

### Errors

An error fails the task that raised it, and propagates to the parent unless something handles it.
Errors come from activities, child workflows, expressions (`NameError`, a bad subscript, ...),
`raise` with `type: error`, and the engine itself. A failed activity is retried first, according
to its [retry policy](#retry-policy); only the final failure counts.

`on_error` on a task handles an error raised by its kind or by its `output`:

| `on_error` | What happens |
|---|---|
| absent | The error propagates to the parent task |
| `do` present | `do` runs in the task's place, in the same scopes. Inside `do`, `_` is the error |
| `catch: true` | The error is consumed. The task succeeds with `do`'s result (or `null` without `do`). The task's own `output` is **not** applied, because it assumes success; use `do`'s `output` to store something |
| `catch: false` (default) | After `do` completes, the original error keeps propagating. Use it for cleanup and compensation |

The error, bound to `_` inside `do`:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `error_type` | The error's type name, such as `ActivityError` or a `raise` task's `error_type` |
| `error_message` | The message |
| `error_detail` | Extra detail, when available |

More rules:

- An error raised inside `do` replaces the original error and propagates.
- An error while evaluating `skip_if` is not handled by the task's own `on_error`.
- A container's `on_error` handles any error a child let through.
- `on_error` catches every error type. To handle only some, catch, store the error and re-raise
  the others with `raise`.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: error-handling-example

context:
  reservation: null
  checkout_error: null

input:
  fail_payment: true

output:
  reservation: '{{ reservation }}'
  checkout_error: '{{ checkout_error }}'

main:
  tasks:
    - task_name: reserve-stock
      set:
        - reservation: {sku: SKU-A, qty: 1}

    - task_name: checkout
      tasks:
        - task_name: charge-card
          raise:
            if: '{{ fail_payment }}'
            type: error
            error_type: PaymentDeclined
            message: card declined
          on_error:
            # catch: false (the default): compensate, then let the error propagate.
            do:
              task_name: release-stock
              set:
                - reservation: null
        - task_name: confirm
          set:
            - _log#: payment charged          # not reached when charge-card fails
      # The container catches what its children let through.
      on_error:
        catch: true
        do:
          set:
            - checkout_error#: '{{ _ }}'

    - task_name: rethrow-unexpected
      raise:
        if: '{{ checkout_error is not None and checkout_error["error_type"] != "PaymentDeclined" }}'
        type: error
        error_type: CheckoutError
        message: '{{ checkout_error["error_message"] }}'
```

### Control signals

`raise` with a type other than `error` sends a **control signal**. A signal is not an error:
`on_error` never sees it, and the tasks it unwinds through skip their `output`.

| `raise.type` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `error` (default) | Fails with `error_type` (default `WorkflowError`) and `message` |
| `terminate` | Stops the whole workflow. The run completes **successfully**; `output` is evaluated and gets `terminate_message` |
| `exit` | Leaves the nearest enclosing `tasks` container, which completes; execution continues after it |
| `break` | Leaves the nearest enclosing `loop`, which completes with the results collected so far |
| `continue` | Ends the current loop iteration (from any depth inside it) with result `null`; the next one starts |

`exit` must be inside a `tasks` container, and `break` and `continue` inside a `loop`, without
crossing a `workflow` / `function` boundary or a state machine callback. The validator checks
this.

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: control-signals-example

context:
  kept: []

input:
  numbers: [1, -2, 3, 0, 5]

output:
  kept: '{{ kept }}'                  # [1, 3]

main:
  tasks:
    - task_name: nothing-to-do
      raise:
        if: '{{ len(numbers) == 0 }}'
        type: terminate
        message: no numbers given

    - task_name: filter
      loop:
        in: '{{ numbers }}'
        foreach: n
        do:
          tasks:
            - raise:
                if: '{{ n < 0 }}'
                type: continue        # skip negatives
            - raise:
                if: '{{ n == 0 }}'
                type: break           # stop at the first zero
            - set:
                - kept: '{{ kept + [n] }}'
```

### Error types

The `error_type` an `on_error` handler sees is one of:

| `error_type` | Raised when |
|---|---|
| any name you choose | A `raise` task with `error_type` set |
| `WorkflowError` | A `raise` task without `error_type` |
| `ConditionTypeError` | A condition evaluated to something other than a `bool` |
| `LoopTypeError` | `loop.in` did not evaluate to an iterable |
| `NameError` | An expression read a name that is not defined |
| the activity's own type | An activity failed after its retries, for example `ValueError` for an invalid input |
| the child's error type | A child workflow or function failed; its error propagates with its own type |

`AbortError` is the conventional type for "stop this run as aborted":
`raise: {type: error, error_type: AbortError, message: ...}`.

A `wait_for` timeout is **not** an error: its result is `null`.

---

## Retry policy

A retry policy controls the timeouts and retries of an activity, or of a `sync` child workflow. It
is applied by the Temporal runtime; the in-memory runtime ignores it.

An activity's effective policy is `header.metadata.default_activity_retry_policy` with the
activity's own `options.retry_policy` laid over it, field by field.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `timeout_sec` | Timeout of one attempt |
| `schedule_to_close_timeout_sec` | Overall timeout, across all attempts |
| `heartbeat_timeout_sec` | Fail an attempt that has not heartbeated for this long |
| `heartbeat_interval_sec` | How often the activity heartbeats. Heartbeating is on only when both heartbeat fields are set |
| `max_attempts` | Total attempts, the first one included. `0` means unlimited |
| `initial_interval_sec` | Wait before the first retry |
| `backoff_coefficient` | Multiplier applied to the wait after each retry |
| `maximum_interval_sec` | Upper bound on the wait between retries |
| `non_retryable_error_types` | Error types that fail immediately, without retrying |

```yaml
header:
  schema_version: 2.0.0
  workflow_name: retry-policy-example
  metadata:
    default_activity_retry_policy:
      max_attempts: 3
      initial_interval_sec: 1
      timeout_sec: 60

main:
  task_name: fetch-report
  activity:
    type: http.request
    input:
      method: GET
      url: https://httpbin.org/get
      raise_for_status: true
    options:
      retry_policy:                   # max_attempts and timeout_sec override the default;
        max_attempts: 5               # initial_interval_sec (1) is inherited
        timeout_sec: 10
        backoff_coefficient: 2.0
        non_retryable_error_types: [ValueError]
```

---

## Reserved names

These names are bound by the engine. They cannot be written as variables or used as a loop's
`foreach` or `index` name:

- `_`
- `__context__`, `__sys_info__`, `__user_info__`, and every name that starts and ends with `__`
- `event`

Caller input keys that are reserved are dropped silently.

---

## Validating a wfspec

`moco validate` checks a wfspec against the wfspec schema and the activity catalog (activity
types and their input fields) before anything runs:

```bash
moco validate my-workflow.yaml
```

Besides the document's shape, it checks rules a schema cannot express:

- `task_name` values are unique in the document;
- a write target is well formed and does not use a reserved name or an unknown modifier;
- `raise: exit` is inside a `tasks` container, and `break` / `continue` inside a `loop`;
- `error_type` is used only with `type: error`;
- `branches` starts with `if`, and a single `else` comes last;
- a nested loop does not reuse an enclosing loop's `foreach` or `index` name;
- a `workflow` task has exactly one source, and `function` is not combined with a `mode` other
  than `inline`;
- state machine state names exist, automatic transitions have a `to_state`, and
  `checkpoint_policy` is used only when the state machine is `main`;
- rule `id`s are unique, and a `wait_for` without `event` has a `timeout_sec`.
