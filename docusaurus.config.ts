 * The sibling Moco apps. All of them are served from this same host root by the
 * shared nginx (see `moco-nginx/conf.d/locations.conf`), so navigating to one is
 * an ordinary same-tab link — keep this set and its labels in step with the
 * switchers in moco-home, moco-ui and moco-apps/*.
 *
 * None of these are Docusaurus routes, which is why each needs three opt-outs:
 * `pathname://` keeps the link out of the client-side router, `autoAddBaseUrl`
 * keeps `/docs/` off the front of the path, and `target: '_self'` overrides the
 * `_blank` Docusaurus adds to anything it reads as external.
